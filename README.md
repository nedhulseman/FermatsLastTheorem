### This is a farcical application where the application will seemingly disporove Fermats Last Theorem by identifying feaux solutions,
that will work if plugged into a calculator. In reality, the solutuon is just really, really close and if extended to an appropriate 
amount of digits, the solution would be shown to be false.
